# VRC-ScreenSpace-CameraOverride
Shader/Prefab that let's you show a RenderTexture directly in a camera. Simply drop your VRC camera into the sphere.

### Setup

1. Import the Unity Package into your project and navigate to **LiveDimensions/Prefabs**.
2. Drag and drop the **CameraOverride** prefab into your scene and position it to your liking.
3. Select the sphere and make sure to set your Render Texture in the shader properties.

To show the Render Texture in your VRC Desktop window (while in VR) simply drop your VRC Stream Camera inside the sphere and make sure to lock it in place.
